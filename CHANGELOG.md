## 1.0.5

### Bug fixes

- Updated dependency @lillallol/pdf-outline to the version that has fixed the extra pdf refs bug. The bug was caused by creating more pdf refs than the number of outline nodes. That made the outlined pdf file get corrupted if it was edited with a pdf annotator.

### Other

-   added `CHANGELOG.md`
-   updated dependencies
